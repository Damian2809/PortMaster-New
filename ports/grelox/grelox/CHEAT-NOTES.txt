So...Too hard for you, huh? Fear not! 
 
 The developer of this game has added a few cheats! While I did not include each of the cheats in this port,
I have incorporated one of them that I found to be super helpful that maintains a fairness in the game progression & doesn't break anything.

 **If you wish to tinker with the other cheats, feel free to add them within the game.gptk** 

>>Pushing the R2 shoulder button on the main menu/title screen, will enable cheats.
While in game/level, pressing START button when low on power, will add life to your Life Bar.

 NOTE: THESE CHEATS MAY BE UNSTABLE IN THE ORIGINAL GAME BUT ALSO UNSTABLE IN THE PORT.
                       (Please use these cheats with the above note in mind.)
